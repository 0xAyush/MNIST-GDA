# MNIST-GDA
Basic Generative AI
AutoEncoder trained on MNIST, Generative AutoEncoder, Denoising AutoEncoder

A set of autoencoder models I created for a series of projects

GEM contains a generative model based on the MNIST dataset and some PCA logic in the latent space

The larger model is a denoising autoencoder which can also be used for limited generative capability.
